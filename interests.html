    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>I have always had a strong interest in music. I first began experimenting with electronic music in high school, where I learned to sample with Audacity and used MPTracker for more straightforward melodic composition. Through college, I had largely moved to using Renoise and Ableton. In grad school, I <em>finally</em> learned how to play a physical instrument, and I started learning guitar from my brother's hand-me-down guitar. Now, with various levels of competency, I have been learning to play guitar, bass, mandolin, and banjo. I've also been getting more interested in using different guitar pedals (a few of which are aesthetically displayed on left).
