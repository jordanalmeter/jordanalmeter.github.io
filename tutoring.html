    <h3>Tutoring</h3>
    <p>
        I have several years of teaching experience, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Precaclulus Algebra</li>
            <li>Precalculus Trigonometry</li>
            <li>Calculus I (non-engineering route as well as brief, one-semester versions)</li>
            <li>Calculus I for engineers</li>
            <li>Calculus II</li>
            <li>Statistics</li>
        </ul>
        In addition, I have TA'd for Calculus III, and in the course of earning my Math PhD I have taken nearly every standard undergraduate math course (linear algebra, differential equations, numerical analysis, and more.).
        <br>
        I offer one-on-one support for higher-level high school and college-level math courses. I focus on working with students to identify gaps in their knowledge base, explain material, as well as homework help and review.
        <br>My hours are flexible. My current (Spring 2025) schedule is open, 2-6 MWF, 10-6 TuTh. I am based in Raleigh and can travel through the NC Triangle.
        <br>
