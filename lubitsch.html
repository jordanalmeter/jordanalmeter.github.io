    <h3>Ernst Lubitsch</h3>
    <p>I love the films of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Lubitsch#Filmography"> Ernst Lubitsch</a>. He is famous for his sophisticated light comedies. I include in my list of reviews every feature length film, although I omit his early short films if I have not seen them. I also omit his lost films. This page is under construction, as I continue to see his films and write my thoughts on any films I have seen but haven't written about.
	</p>
	<p>Note that some of these films, especially his German silent-era films, contain depictions which are today considered offensive or demeaning. I do not wish to excuse these depictions; they were wrong then, and they are wrong now.</p>
	<p>If you are at all interested in the films of Lubitsch, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.movingimageagency.com/ernstcast"> How Would Lubitsch Do It</a>, a (now finished) podcast covering each Lubitsch film sequentially. While I had loved Lubitsch before listening, it was this work which gave me the resources to dive into many of Lubitsch's lesser-known works.</p>
	<p>Lubitsch was known for having a trademark style, called the "Lubitsch Touch." This style is known for being witty, urbane, sophisticated, racy, and understated, and discussion of his work often focuses on characterizing this style. Billy Wilder relays a quote by Lubitsch:
		<blockquote>
			Make it clear to them, but don’t spell it out like the audience are just a bunch of idiots. Just aim it slightly above their station and they’re going to get it. This is what I learned from Ernst Lubitsch. He had a real touch, a gift of involving the audience into writing the script with him as it was unfolding on the screen.

			In other words, he was not the kind of a director who kind of hammered it down and said, “Now listen to me, you idiots. There now, put down the popcorn bag, I’m going to tell you something. Two and two is four.” He said, “No, just give them two and two and let them add it up. They’re going to do it for you. And they’re going to have fun with it. They’re going to play the game with you.”
		</blockquote>
		
		Lubitsch often used objects in indirect ways in his films. In <em>The Marriage Circle</em>, there is a <a href="https://youtu.be/LaCnazvLusI?t=1228">famous scene</a> where a couple is shown having breakfast; their egg and coffe are pushed away. The main action of the couple's embrace is not shown, but it is certainly enough for the audience to infer. Similarly, there is a sequence in <em>Trouble in Paradise</em> where an illicit date between a gentleman thief and the woman he intends to rob is told by a series of clocks as time passes, with the characters heard from off-screen. Mary Pickford once described Lubitsch as <q>a director of doors.</q>

	<ol>
		<li> <b>When Four Do the Same, 1917.</b> Not seen.</li>
		<li> <b>The Eyes of the Mummy Ma, 1918.</b> Not seen.</li>
		<li> <b>I Don't Want to Be a Man, 1918.</b> A very enjoyable short film. Ossi Oswalda, who later stars in The Oyster Princess and The Doll, plays a young rich girl who wants to smoke, drink, talk with strange men, and generally live life and party, and whose uncle and governess prevent her from doing so. She attends a party as a man, and soon bonds with her strict male tutor. The two exchange drunken kisses before she reveals the truth. Many later films explore this sort of gender-trickery romance, such as Victor and Victoria (1933), the 1982 remake Victor/Victoria, or Mulan, but I've never seen it treated this nonchalantly. For all intents and purposes, the male tutor was perfectly okay with falling in love with another man! Even if the film ends with a straight romance, it still is plenty transgressive.</li>
		<li><b>Carmen, 1918.</b> Not seen.</li>
		<li><b>The Doll, 1919.</b> The nephew of a rich baron is pressured to get married, so he plans to marry a robotic doll to trick his uncle. The daughter of the dollmaker, played by Ossi Oswalda, accidentally breaks the doll, so she then pretends to be the doll. The film carries several layers of deceit, as the daughter fools the nephew who fools his uncle. Ultimately, this film is glorious, creative anarchy, with wonderfully designed German Expressionist sets and an opening scene showing the director taking out the sets and actors from a toybox and arranging them in a diorama. It perfectly sets the tone for what is a wild, anarchic film.</li>
		<li><b>Meyer from Berlin, 1919.</b> Not seen.</li>
		<li><b>The Oyster Princess, 1919.</b> This film feels radical, chaotic, full of life. The Oyster Princess is played by Ossi Oswalda, the heiress to an Oyster tycoon who wishes to marry into a royal family. The film contains decadent scenery, huge crowds, wild partying, and mistaken identities complicating a romantic plot. On an ugly note, the poster of the film plays on what I consider to be blackface imagery, but the film contains black actors playing black servant parts which is honestly better than I expected from most German films of the time. Overall, probably one of the more accessible of his early silent films. There is a kinship between this film and the dance sequence from the Pierre Etaix film, Yoyo.</li>
		<li><b>Madame DuBarry, 1919.</b> Not seen.</li>
		<li><b>Sumurun, 1920.</b> Not seen.</li>
		<li><b>Anna Boleyn, 1920.</b> Not seen.</li>
		<li><b>The Wild Cat, 1921.</b> This film is truly anarchic in style. Pola Negri plays the uncivilized leader of a group of bandits who falls in love with a lieutenant. The sets are boldly designed, full of squiggles and postmodern  architectural curves, and shots are framed by surprising geometric mattes. While the story is very basic and the comedy was very broad and fell flat for me, the stylistic choices still remain stunning. There's a thematic connection to Trouble in Paradise. In that film, theft is a very seductive act; a racy transgression, as the bandit leader robs the lieutenant and strips him to his underwear. The lieutenant also is pursuing the daughter of his commander, and the film ends with the bandit leader accepting that the lieutenant would be happier with the commander's daughter than with her, and so she "bows out." This bowing out shows up in a lot of other films by Lubitsch, and feels like one of the key ingredients of the Lubitsch touch, alongside tactful omission or noble deception. If it would only hurt, we don't need to make our feelings known; if someone would be happier with someone else, then true love would let them leave.</li>
		<li><b>The Wife of the Pharaoh, 1922.</b> Not Seen.</li>
		<li><b>The Flame, 1923.</b> Not Seen. Partially lost.</li>
		<li><b>Rosita, 1923.</b> Not Seen.</li>
		<li><b>The Marriage Circle, 1924.</b> This film was later remade as One Hour with You. Both films take a farcical approach to infidelity, but in this one, the protagonist is much less sympathetic in his infidelity. Overall, I think the remake is better in just about every way. Still, something about the direction really struck me the last time I watched it&mdash;I love the older, stagey methods of blocking. Characters move and embrace one another as if recreating poses in paintings, and the result is something quite often beautiful to look at.</li>
		<li><b>Three Women, 1924.</b> Not Seen.</li>
		<li><b>Forbidden Paradise, 1924.</b> Not Seen. The best extant copy of this film has not been released to the public.</li>
		<li><b>Lady Windermere's Fan, 1925.</b> Directing an Oscar Wilde adaptation, removing the Wilde text, and presenting the play as a straight drama is a bold move! The plot still works played straight, though. The way that the story resolves without major plot details revealed to all characters is very much in the vein of Wilde. Wilde said, "aesthetics are higher than ethics," and here, it feels that plays out. The character Mrs. Erlynne is the embodiment of noble deception, and here her sacrifice is incredibly bittersweet.</li>
		<li><b>So This is Paris, 1926.</b> Not Seen.</li>
		<li><b>The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg, 1927.</b> Not Seen.</li>
		<li><b>Eternal Love, 1929.</b> Not Seen.</li>
		<li><b>The Love Parade, 1929.</b> This musical just about saved Paramount from going under. It is risque and racy, and really features one of the huge recurring Lubitsch plot themes of a seductive outsider man playing a role and entering into high society. Also, Lubitsch just completely gets Maurice Chevalier as a persona.</li>
		<li><b>Monte Carlo, 1930.</b> It's almost shocking that they didn't go with Maurice Chevalier. The film is a fun romantic comedy double deception, and the song "Trimming the Women" remains in my head.</li>
		<li><b>The Smiling Lieutenant, 1931.</b> The film introduces a love triangle between the lieutenant played by Chevalier, a female bandleader played by Claudette Colbert, and a princess played by Miriam Hopkins. Another film where an outsider romances his way into royalty, but what really shocked me the first time seeing it was the bowing out at the end. It's atypical for a character to happily concede, and not only that, wish the new couple marital happiness with a song like "Jazz up your Lingerie." The narrative dissatisfaction is jarring at first.</li>
		<li><b>Broken Lullaby, 1932.</b> Not Seen.</li>
		<li><b>One Hour With You, 1932.</b> I love this movie. The intro songs are racy pre-code magic, and Maurice Chevalier plays against type, with him addressing the audience directly to inform us that no, he is not a lothario, he really loves his wife and only his wife, played by Jeanette MacDonald. Despite this, his wife's best friend is intent on seducing him, and several misunderstandings arising from him trying to keep his wife from knowing about her disloyal friend result in his wife pushing him away, and her having a small dalliance of her own. After all this chaos, and a pre-code gay moment where Charles Ruggles's servant makes him dress up in tights, the two get back together, singing to the world: <blockquote>Ladies&mdash;and gentlemen&mdash;if he were your husband&mdash;and she were your wife&mdash;and you find out he's a Don Juan&mdash;and you find out she has dreams&mdash;and he confesses&mdash;and she admits&mdash;but you like him&mdash;and you love her&mdash;and you adore him&mdash;and you're crazy about her&mdash;what would you do?&mdash;That's what I do to."</blockquote> Just two years later, motion pictures would be censored systematically by the Hayes code, and an ending like this would never be allowed on film.</li>
		<li><b>Trouble in Paradise, 1932.</b> This is one of the most acclaimed Lubitsch films, and with good reason. The plot follows two thieves, played by Miriam Hopkins and Herbert Marshall, who meet while robbing one another in Venice, and the love triangle that develops as the two plan a con/heist on a wealthy woman played by Kay Francis. The film is risque and witty, but the thing that stands out to me is that the film is dedicated to the premise of theft as being a form of seduction. A scene early on shows the two thieves stealing from one another and falling in love once they reveal themselves to another. The chemistry is electric every time one character learns the other has picked the other's pocket. Given that this is a Depression era film about stealing from the rich, I find the way it treats wealth very fascinating. The thieves played by Hopkins and Marshall are both class pretenders, the audience rooting for them as they cheat, swindle, and steal from the bumbling William Everett Horton (who, in a bit of very pre-code intimation, is distracted by a whispered conversation about the harems of Constantinople). Overall, one gets the impression that the wealthy deserve to have their money taken, and that the thieves are just more straightforward in the ways they want to get their money.</li>
		<li><b>If I Had a Million, 1932.</b> Only a short, one-minute sequence in this anthology film is directed by Lubitsch. It is witty and understated, and does not beat the allegations that Lubitsch was a director of doors.</li>
		<li><b>Design for Living, 1933.</b></li>
		<li><b>The Merry Widow, 1934.</b></li>
		<li><b>Desire, 1936.</b> This film was only produced by Lubitsch, but directed by Frank Borzage. The first half of the film is absolutely wonderful, a bit of understated subterfuge and wit involving the theft and smuggling of a pearl necklace. Gary Cooper plays an American on vacation in Europe getting tangled up with a con artist played by Marlene Dietrich. The light, sparkling wit of these two meeting is much more memorable than the conventional drama when these two characters fall in love, which I sadly do not feel the Lubitsch thumbprint on. Sometimes the meet cute is just so good that you're willing to forgive a lot! I do believe that a romantic comedy which abandons the comedy in the name of romance in the third act, does not understand either romance or comedy. The film is adapted from a German film/play, Happy Days in Aranjuez. The screenwriting team includes Edwin Mayer, who would work with Lubitsch on To Be or Not To Be, and Samuel Hoffenstein, who would later work on Cluny Brown.</li>
