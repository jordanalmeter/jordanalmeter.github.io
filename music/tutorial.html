            <h1>Introduction to Electronic Music Composition</h1>
            This site is under construction as it is a personal project.
            <h2>My experience with music</h2>
            <p>
                I did not grow up as a musical child. My brothers had grown up playing cello, viola, and violin--very nearly a quartet!--but I found myself unable to put in the time or focus required for an instrument, despite growing up with so many in the house. However, starting in high school I found myself making electronic music on the family computer. It started with editing music files in Audacity--speeding up, slowing down, adding reverb--and it eventually lead to making more sophisticated compositions. I later took several music courses in college, and I started learning guitar and piano as an adult. This is fairly unusual in the history of music, where most people learn performance long before composition, and most of the education I received in music had taken for granted that people knew how to sing or play an instrument. Today, while I enjoy performing and playing an instrument as a tool for composition, I still love making wholly electronic compositions.

            <h2>Composition versus performance</h2>
            <p>
                Composing on an instrument is an incredibly free process. Once you learn an instrument well, notes come freely, and you are only limited by your own technical skills. Many composers will work on a melody on an instrument or through singing, and perfect it before starting the uncreative work of transcribing it to a music program. Composing for a computer is different. Early computer music programs, called trackers, felt like editing spreadsheets, placing notes in columns for the computer to read. For many people, that process is tedious

            <h2>The need for composition-first music education</h2>
            <p>
                I don't know whether I would recommend learning music the way that I learned music. Learning to sing or play an instrument and gaining proficiency before composing your own music is the norm, and for very good reason. However, a good number of people across the world already are learning music in this way. They don't have access to instruments, but they do have a smartphone, maybe a chromebook, and an internet connection. There are a number of free DAWs which I would highly recommend, as well as a number of programs aimed at the inexperienced music maker which promise to make music making easy but ultimately prevent students from learning.

            <h2>Beepbox</h2>
            Beepbox is the most robust, totally free browser-based music making program I have ever seen. It is incredibly accessible and portable.
            <h1>Resources</h1>
            <a href="https://iastate.pressbooks.pub/comprehensivemusicianship/">Comprehensive Musicianship</a> from Iowa State University Digital Press, an online free music theory textbook.
            <h1>Lesson 0: Fundamentals of music</h1>
            We can outline four fundamental concepts of music: <em>rhythm</em>, <em>melody</em>, <em>harmony</em>, and <em>harmony</em>. Rhythm is the arrangement of sounds in time, melody is the rise and fall in pitch of a voice or instrument over time, and harmony is the way that different voices or instruments sound when played together. Timbre (pronounced tamber) is also known as tone; it represents the way that an instrument or voice sounds, independent of pitch. For example, a violin, a harp, and a piano may all play the same note, but they are distinguishable by their timbres.

            <h1>Lesson 1: Play</h1>
            Open beepbox. Place any series of notes on the page, and then hit play. Observe the following things about the following screenshot:
            <ul>
                <li>The music plays from left to right in the pattern. Left-to-right represents the time each note is played.</li>
                <li>Up-and-down represents the pitch of a note. A note placed higher on the screen is a higher pitch.</li>
                <li>The length or duration of a note is how long a note is played for. Some of the notes here are played for longer than others. In beepbox, </li>
                <li>The first few notes in the sequence are played at the same pitch, but in a rhythmic pattern.</li>
                <li>Halfway through the pattern, we introduce a sequence of notes with different pitches, played one after the other. A sequence of notes with different pitches one after the other is called a melody.</li>
                <li>At the end of the pattern, we introduce several notes with different pitches played at the same time. This is called a <em>chord</em>. Chords are the combinations of different pitches, and make up the basic building blocks of harmony.</li>
                <li>Beepbox allows you to pick your instrument.</li>
            </ul>
