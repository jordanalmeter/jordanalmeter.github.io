    <h2>Teaching Credentials</h2>
    <p>
        I earned my PhD in Mathematics from North Carolina State University in 2022, where I TA'd, tutored, and taught. In addition, I have been teaching at Durham Tech for the past three years. I have taught 8 courses and TA'd for 9, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Precaclulus Algebra</li>
            <li>Precalculus Trigonometry</li>
            <li>Calculus I (several versions)</li>
            <li>Calculus II</li>
            <li>Calculus III</li>
            <li>Statistics</li>
        </ul>
        I also have taken most standard college math courses. If you are interested in higher level math tutoring, such as in combinatorics, differential equations, discrete math, graph theory, or numerical analysis, then I may be able to help.
